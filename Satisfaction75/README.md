This keyboard's firmware includes a special little keyboard cat to help you type better

These are the in progress photos showing off the through hole to hotswap conversion. I used Milmax sockets as they had the lowest profile and least chance to cause clearance issues with the build

Edit: I updated the firmware for bongocat according to this github pages documentation. To get it to work with more recent versions of QMK the config.h file needs to be updated and the oled driver needs to be lowercase.
